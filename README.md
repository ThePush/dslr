## Description:

This is a four parts project, the three first parts are about Exploratory Data analysis. The last part implements a class that performs the Multinomial Logistic Regression algorithm, with batch size as option to chose an optimization algorithm (such as stochastic gradient descent, batch or mini-batch gradient descent).


## Describe.py:

Custom implementation of the panda's library describe function. I added the mean absolute deviation (MAD) and the coefficient of variation (CV) to the output.

1/ To generate the model, plot the results and save the model in the <theta.csv> file, use the [logreg_train.py] script:

```shell
$> python3 logreg_train.py <datasets/dataset_train.csv>
```

2/ Then use the model to predict classes. The script will use the model generated by the [logreg_train.py] script and saved in the <theta.csv> file.

```shell
$> python3 logreg_predict.py
```
